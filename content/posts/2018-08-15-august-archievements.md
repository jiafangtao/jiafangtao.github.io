- Security Trainings. Those traning sessions are very helpful and useful as we are engaged in more and more cloud computing work. Web is open to attackers every second. So as software engineers, we must sharpen our skill set to guard our assets in the cloud.

- Got chance to get more familiar with Linux Bash programming, because I got stuck in some pitfalls.
Bash is an easy-to-learn programming language while it's more easy to make mistakes with it because it's quite different with other programming languages like C++/JAVA.

- Effective Note-taking. I have to admit that although I have taken notes since I was a primary school student I didn't think seriously about note-taking until rencent months. Note-taking is a critical skill no matter you are school kids or firm engineers. I'm learning note-taking from scratch now and hope later I can sumarize what I learn here. *TODO: put a link here for the post of note-taking*

- Basic docker commands like `docker run` - need to gaim more hands-on experience

- Good talk with smart guys like Ronnie, Jianghua, Rock and Bart. 常与同好争高下，不共傻逼论短长。
